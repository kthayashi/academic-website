I am a Ph.D. candidate in Dr. Nathan Kraft's [Plant Community Ecology Lab](https://sites.lifesci.ucla.edu/eeb-kraft/) in the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). My research interests are broadly in plant community ecology and biogeography. My dissertation research aims to understand how species interactions in spatially variable environments shape plant species distributions and coexistence across spatial scales, using a California grassland as a model system. I am also passionate about data science (especially using R) and evidence-based STEM teaching.
